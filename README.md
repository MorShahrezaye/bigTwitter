<h1>Description</h1>
This is a simple R package that is developed to enable researchers downloading data from Twitter API using multiple keys. This package is developed for research and teaching purposes.

The main advantages of this package over the other R packages are:
<ul>
  <li>Capability of using multiple Twitter keys! If you have 10 keys then you can download the data 10 times faster!</li>
  <li>The functions return the complete output as a datatable object (other packages trim the data!)</li>
</ul>

There is no gurantee that the functions perform as intended and there might be bugs in the code!
